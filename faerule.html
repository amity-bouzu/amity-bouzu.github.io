I decided that I wanted to challenge myself by drawing different characters from the Legend of Zelda series as mythical creatures. This is Hyrule (from the fancomic Linked Universe), as a fairy. I wanted to draw him as the lightsource initially, but after realizing that I didn't really know how to make that look good, I changed the light source to be his wings instead. I do like how it turned out.
