        <p style="color:white; text-align:center;">This was the first project in ART 75. For this project, we were told to make a short (~1 minute long) video that was a response to our chosen prompt or topic for the semester.<br><br> The topic I chose for the semester was Pride. <br><br> To be more specific, I mean LGBTQIA+ people, their rights, their community - essentially anything that had to do with being queer, is what I decided what my theme would be. <br><br> For the first project, because we were allowed to do pretty much anything we wanted, I thought it would be an interesting choice to make the project an animation. I've taken an animation class for two years in High School, and hadn't really gotten the opportunity to work with 2D animation for a long while (it's a skill I want to heighten but not what I want to proffessionaly pursue), I thought it would be fun to work with the medium again. <br><br> The reason why I chose to go with a torch animation is because my one of my first animation works ever was one of a flame - and because flames look as if they're dancing in the air, I've always felt as if fire is something magical. Another reason why I chose it is because of what torches tend to represent. "Carrying the Torch" often refers to carrying the weight, or being the light in the darkness - of being the one to guide the way. The queer community exists in the way it does today thanks to all those who carried the torch before - so through the use of the torch motif I am also paying homage to them.</p>
