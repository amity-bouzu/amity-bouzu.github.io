<p style="color:white; text-align:center;">
​For the final, I thought it would be fun to try making some 3D models of my characters using the program Zbrush. I'd used Zbrush in the past, but it'd been almost an entire year since I'd last used it, so I thought it would be fun to revisit it. I also wanted to make something that looked nicer than the things I've made in the past. 
</p>
</head>
<body>


<table class="table table-dark">

<tr>
<td>
  <img src="images/amelohead.png" alt="What I made almost a whole year ago." style="width:800px;" class="center">
</td>

<td>
<img src="images/renderedamelo.png" alt="The fullbody of this character." style="width:800px;" class="center">
</td>

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p style="color:white; text-align:center;">
​The two images above are my previous attempts at making a model of a character in Zbrush. When in the process of making the full-body, and later rigging the model for animation, I ended up losing a lot of detail, polycounts, and quality in the model. So for this project, I wanted to prioritize the model-making and the rendering of that model in good quality. 
</p>

<p style="color:white; text-align:center;">
First, it was time to practice. I started with a sphere, and spent a number of hours building that up into a face. 
</p>

<table class="table table-dark">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
  <img src="images/noface.png" alt="Progress shot of a vaguely head-shaped thing." style="width:800px;" class="center">
</td>

<img src="images/nosebuilding.png" alt="It's vaguely face-shaped now." style="width:800px;" class="center">
</td>

<td>
<img src="images/nose.png" alt="It has a nose and nothing else." style="width:800px;" class="center">
</td>

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


<p style="color:white; text-align:center;">
I wasn't sure how I was going to do the eyes just yet. I either just had to sculpt them into the model, or add some spheres as subtools and have them clip into the model. I ultimately decided on the former, but not before a number of attempts (and hours spent) on the latter. (I think they look really silly.) 
</p>

</tr>

</tbody>
</table>

<p style="color:white; text-align:center;">
Thanks to the power of Zbrush's terrible interface, I ended up accidentally not saving this file-and instead had to start over from an earlier version of the sculpt. I believe this ended up working out in my favor, though-I decided to try sculpting the eyes directly on the head's model instead, rather than adding subtools. 
</p>

  <img src="images/niceface.png" alt="The most 3D face I ended up making." style="width:800px;" class="center">
<br>
<p style="color:white; text-align:center;">
After making this face, I thought it would be a good idea to shift away from face-building and instead to hair. In the past, building up the hair was what I struggled with most, so I wanted to try working on that, as well as learn how to use the feature Polypaint. Previously, I'd rendered the model I made using Adobe Substance Painter, but that was a part of why I lost a large amount of the model's quality. 
</p>
<p style="color:white; text-align:center;">
I decided not to build up hair on the head I'd already made-as I was going to try and make the hair of one of my characters, and my artstyle is more cartoonish/anime-esque than the face I'd made. So, I instead used a preset that was already provided by Zbrush, and started adding on top of that. I added cylinder subtools, and then molded them to the shape that I needed for the hair.

<p style="color:white; text-align:center;">
Above is the character I was trying to model. 
</p>

<p style="color:white; text-align:center;">
After I finished building up the hair, it was time to color her in! I ended up watching a number of Youtube tutorials on how to use polypaint. You have to turn on RGB values, as well off turn off the Zadd and Zsub features, then pick a color. (I also changed the model's material, from the standard grey material to leather. I thought the texture worked better.) I forgot to take screenshots through most of the process, but I do have these. 
</p>

<table class="table table-dark">
<tbody>

  <img src="images/coloringgin1.png" alt="Starting to color her in." style="width:800px;" class="center">

</td>

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p style="color:white; text-align:center;">
Once I was done adding color, it was time to render! I rendered using the tool in Zbrush for it. Despite the fact that the entire point was that I make a 3D model, I somehow forgot that she was a 3D model and only rendered shots of her from the front. (I'd go back and make more, but by the time I realized, the two-week free trial of Zbrush I had ended.) 
</p>

<table class="table table-dark">

<tr>
<td>
  <img src="images/ginrender1.png" alt="Renders!!" style="width:800px;" class="center">

</tbody>
</table>

<p style="color:white; text-align:center;">
Next, it was time to build the real thing. While I liked how the first trial turned out, and would have been willing to use it as the final result, I wanted to try and make something more difficult. So the character I chose to model next was one with curly hair, and four eyes, and a LOT of accessories. 
</p>

  <img src="images/imuruillust.png" alt="The character I decided to try and model." style="width:800px;" class="center">
<br>

<p style="color:white; text-align:center;">
I used a similar strategy to the previous character when making this one. I started with the preset anime-head that Zbrush provided, and then began to build up the face. I needed to start with the face this time around, due to the fact that the character's anatomy was different-four eyes instead of two. 
</p>

<table class="table table-dark">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
  <img src="images/alien.png" alt="Starting to build up the four eyes." style="width:800px;" class="center">
</td>

<td>
<img src="images/alienflat.png" alt="You can now see that she has four eyes." style="width:800px;" class="center">
</td>

<td>
<img src="images/alienwithhair.png" alt="Starting to add hair." style="width:800px;" class="center">
</td>

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p style="color:white; text-align:center;">
After I finished the face, I began to add the hair and accessories. This was honestly the hardest part, as I had to figure out how to make the curls in her hair actually look like curls. I'm not super sure that I totally pulled it off, but I do like how they turned out. (I also simplified some of the accessories, such as subtly adjusting the shape of the earrings to be more simple, removing her lip rings, as well as not adding some of the fangs on her jawpiece. This helped make the modeling process faster and smoother.)

</td>

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p style="color:white; text-align:center;">
After that, it was time to add coloring! Once again, I forgot to take screenshots of my progress once I actually began to add color. I suppose I was too in-the-zone. I do have these shots, though! 
</p>

<table class="table table-dark">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
  <img src="images/coloringimuru1.png" alt="She's very pink." style="width:800px;" class="center">

<img src="images/coloringimuru2.png" alt="Still very pink!!" style="width:800px;" class="center">
</td>

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p style="color:white; text-align:center;">
She was colored in, so it was time to render!! I again used the rendering feature already present in Zbrush. 
</p>

<table class="table table-dark">

<tr>

  <img src="images/imurugreybg.png" alt="Render on the Zbrush grey background." style="width:800px;" class="center">

</tbody>
</table>

<p style="color:white; text-align:center;">
And that's the finished product!! If you want to see my favorite angle/render, as well as a recording of the model rotating, scroll back to the top!!
