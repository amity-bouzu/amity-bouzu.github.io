<p style="color:white; text-align:center;">
​This is Hillary Clinton in the 閉じ込めてみた (Tojikometemita) challenge. It became a trend, starting on pixiv, for artists to draw characters as if they were trapped behind a phone's screen. So for this, I thought it would be a... if not funny, an interesting idea to combine this trend with Hillary Clinton, and the recent meme where she has a very confused face. I had to combine multiple different images in order to put this all together - and it's made me want to try to actually take part in the trend and draw a character trapped behind a screen, rather than just photoshop it. We'll see!!
