        <p style="color:white; text-align:center;">For this project, we weren't really told much about what we were supposed to do. When I initially made this project, my 'performance' involved my friends and I standing in the common room, waving queer flags around. It was a lot of fun to make, sure, but it didn't represent a performance, nor the queer community in the way that I felt was my best.
<br><br>
So I decided to redo it.
<br><br>
When I was speaking with a friend about how I was planning on re-doing my performance video, but hadn't solidified what the performance was going to be yet, they offered to let me record them as they did drag for the first time. Drag is an important part of the queer community, and is a performance in an of itself, so I thought it was the perfect choice. 
<br><br> 
When recording this video, I thought that it would be fun to make the video itself somewhat of a performance as well - by switching angles and shots all around in a way that I thought was fun, as well as including a number of the mistakes my friend made - such as dropping the makeup or the mirror, at times. Drag is supposed to be a fun performance, so I did my best to make the video a fun performance as well. 
<br><br>
I also included a couple shots of myself in this video - because this was something we did together, and because the queer community is, in fact, a community. There were others in the room at the time that didn't want to be part of the video, but I wanted to still represent that facet of being queer, so I thought it would be fun to include some of the clips of us laughing and smiling together. 
<br><br>
I think re-doing this video was the right choice, and I'm very happy with it.
